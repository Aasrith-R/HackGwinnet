## üîß Customization

### Adding Real AI Integration
Replace mock functions in `src/utils/aiMock.js` with actual API calls:
- OpenAI GPT for text generation
- ElevenLabs for text-to-speech
- Weather API for real weather data
- Custom ML models for sleep analysis

### Adding Real Audio Files
1. Add MP3 files to `assets/sounds/` directory
2. Update `SoundMixer.js` to load actual audio files
3. Implement proper audio mixing with expo-av

### Extending Features
- Add more mood options
- Implement sleep stage detection
- Add social features for sleep challenges
- Integrate with wearable devices

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Metro bundler issues**: Clear cache with `npx expo start --clear`
2. **Dependency conflicts**: Delete `node_modules` and reinstall
3. **iOS simulator not starting**: Check Xcode installation
4. **Android emulator issues**: Verify Android Studio setup

### Development Tips
- Use `console.log` for debugging in Expo Go
- Check Metro bundler logs for build errors
- Test on both iOS and Android for compatibility

## üìà Future Enhancements

- Real-time sleep monitoring
- Integration with health apps
- Advanced sleep analytics
- Social sleep challenges
- Wearable device support
- Voice commands
- Smart home integration
